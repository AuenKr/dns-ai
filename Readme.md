DNS Query

Goal: Create DNS Server with ai capability

example: 
dns Query: `dig +short TXT what.is.dns` // Any question
output: `DNS converts domain names into IP addresses, enabling devices to communicate on the internet.`

Inspire from:
Github: `https://github.com/knadh/dns.toys`
Toying with DNS: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANmFZ8rbmnc`

My Goal: Instead of manually calculating particular query, add LLM is bw to answer that query.
Pros: Can answer almost any query.
Cons: It will be very slow.
